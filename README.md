# FC Pac-Man Wordpress plug-in

## Description

This is my Pac-Man game as a wordpress plug-in.

The assets used I found online.

As of now, the game features 6 levels, a scoreboard, a highscore display using the database and fetch the results in real time using AJAX and soundeffects that I also found online.

Future updates will include different worlds (every world will have 6 levels) with different assets, the introduction of new items for Pac-Man to eat and possibly a different AI for every ghost (as of right now every ghost shares the same AI, which is pretty dumb).

Feel free to fork this, edit the code, expand the project or sending me pull requests.
